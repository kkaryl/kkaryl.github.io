To account for the dataset imbalance issue, MixUp training was performed and the Focal loss function was used.\nProblem Statement The objective of this challenge is to build a high performance multi-label classiﬁer for face attributes classiﬁcation using a given dataset. The evaluation set is released one week prior to submission deadline. The higher the prediction accuracy obtained for the private testset, the higher the grades for this challenge.\nThere are some constraints set for this challenge:\n Model should be trained strictly on the trainset of CelebA. Only ImageNet pre-trained models are allowed. Ensemble of models is not allowed.  The deliverables of this challenge include:\n A short report in pdf format of not more than five A4 pages. Predictions of the test set in a text file. Source codes for training and testing the model.  Dataset CelebA The dataset used is from CelebA which contains 200 thousand cropped and aligned faces. The dataset is split into 162,770 images for training, 19,867 images for validation and 19,962 images for testing. There are a total of 40 binary attributes (labels) for each image, with 1 indicating positive prediction, while -1 indicates negative prediction. These attributes are often used to describe a face and some examples include black hair, smiling, mustache. Given an aligned facial image, the classifier must output its prediction for all 40 attributes, making this a multi-label classification problem.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Prior to building the model, EDA was performed to better analyze the given dataset. The frequency distribution of the labels of each dataset split is plotted using matplotlib.\nThe plot shows the following observations:\n The splits looked to be stratiﬁed sampled for train and validation sets. The test set has some attributes sampled more frequently (e.g. Wearing Lipstick, Wavy Hair and Big Lips). The full dataset is highly imbalanced with:  Common attributes like No Beard and Young weighing above 70%. Less than 5% of rare attributes such as Mustache and Bald.    Further EDA process also found:\n Multiple mislabelled images such as:  Mislabelled males as females with Male set to -1. Mislabelled females with No_Beard set to -1.   131 duplicated images with 99 of them having different attribute annotations.  Other things to note:\n Some attribute labels such as \u0026ldquo;Attractive\u0026rdquo; is rather subjective. Train set contains images with annotations, but without faces.  See my codes on:\n CelebA EDA:  Github CelebA Duplicate Check:  Github  Implementation Data Augmentation Data augmentation is an important step in many computer vision tasks due to the scarcity of labelled dataset. It helps to “increase” the training set by creating variations of the original images. This expanded dataset alleviates the problem of overﬁtting and allows the model to generalize better.\nFor the train set, the images are center cropped to 198 × 158 with 50% probability of horizontal ﬂip and 50% probability for aﬃne transformations (shift, scale, rotate), before RGB normalization and conversion to tensors. For the validation and test set, the images are center cropped to 198 × 158 before RGB normalization and conversion to tensor.\nSee my test codes on data augmentations at:  Github\nMixUp Training As recommended by He et al. in their Bag of Tricks paper, MixUp training is an alternate form data augmentation technique. In the training loop, pairs of images in a batch are interpolated using a λ value sampled from a beta distribution of α = 0.2 (hyperparameter). The training loss is also computed using a weighted (λ) linear combination of the two losses calculated from the two labels of the mixed images.\nSee my test codes on MixUp training at:  Github\nFocal loss $$\\begin{align} CE(p_t) \u0026amp;= -log(p_t) \\\\\\\nFL(p_t) \u0026amp;= -\\alpha (1-p_t)^{\\gamma} log (p_t) \\end{align}$$\nDue to the class imbalance problem of the dataset stated in EDA, there are more easy positives like No Beard than hard positives like Gray Hair. As a result, the model might tend to be biased towards learning more representations of the data-dominated class. Hence, by using Focal Loss (Equation 2) over Cross Entropy Loss (Equation 1), it can help the network to learn sparse hard examples better. The hyperparameter α controls the weights of positive and negative samples, while γ adjusts the rate at which easy examples are downweighted. After some empirical tuning, α = 0.25 and γ = 3 were set.\nResults My best model was trained using pre-trained ImageNet MobileNetV2 as backbone with 40 binary classifiers for identifying the attributes. It attained average accuracy of 91.55%, 92.28% and 91.71% on CelebA\u0026rsquo;s train, validation and test set respectively.\nAfter the release of the grades, the source of the private test set was announced to be from lfwA+. My submission obtained a grade of 25/25.\nSee my training notebook at:  Github\nSee my inference notebook at:  Github\nEnd Notes Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of other techniques I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, but did not improve my model:\n Some data augmentations like:  ColorJitter FancyPCA Random brightness and contrast Adding of random Gaussian noise   Random Erasing did not work well with MixUp training Label Smoothing Other backbone models like: ResNet50, ResNeXt50  Random Erasing Random Erasing is like dropout at input level. It cuts out randomly sized areas from random locations of the images with random probability. Much like image impainting, it makes it harder for the classifer to learn by hiding certain semantics from it.\nLabel Smoothing Label smoothing is a regularization technique by Szegedy et al., which perturbs the target variables, to make the model less conﬁdent of its predictions. It does so by performing a weighted linear combination of predicted values by an $\\epsilon$ value e.g. 0.1. It usually performs well on imbalanced datasets.\n","date":1603324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603324800,"objectID":"2a0a4a296d2aa95a2b2b22cb33798ae3","permalink":"https://kkaryl.github.io/project/celeba/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/celeba/","section":"project","summary":"The goal of this challenge is to build a high performing multi-label classiﬁer to identify the facial attributes in photographs.","tags":["Computer Vision","Deep Learning","CNN","EDA","CelebA","MobileNetV2","MixUp Training","Focal loss","Data Augmentations","Random Erasing","Label Smoothing"],"title":"CelebA Facial Attribute Recognition Challenge","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$\n$$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
